# MULTI-JURISDICTION COMPLIANCE RESPONSE MATRIX FOR SHOP GHANA

---

## CUSTOMER A – Abena (Accra, Ghana)

**Applicable Law:** Ghana Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843)

### A. Legal Right to Deletion?

Ghana's DPA provides a right to prevent processing and to correct personal data, but it does not create an absolute "right to be forgotten" equivalent to GDPR Article 17.

However, Abena can:
- Object to further processing
- Withdraw consent (where consent was the basis)
- Request deletion where data is no longer necessary

So yes, she has a **conditional right to deletion**, not an automatic one.

### B. ShopGhana's Obligations

Under Act 843, ShopGhana must:

1. Determine whether the data is still necessary
2. Stop processing data not required for legal/business purposes
3. Delete data not required for:
   - Tax compliance
   - Accounting obligations
   - Fraud prevention

Controllers must ensure:
- Data is retained only as long as necessary
- Data is accurate and not excessive

### C. What Data Can Be Retained?

Even if her account is deleted, ShopGhana may retain:

| Data Type | Retention Justification | Likely Period |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------|
| Transaction invoices | Tax & audit laws (GRA compliance) | 6–7 years |
| Payment records | Anti-fraud, AML | 5–7 years |
| Basic suppression record | To avoid re-contacting her | Indefinite (minimal record) |

All marketing and profile data should be deleted.

### D. Response Deadline

The Ghana DPA does not specify a strict 30-day rule like GDPR, but best practice aligned with regulator guidance is **21–30 days**.

### E. Draft Response to Abena

**Subject:** Confirmation of Your Data Deletion Request

Dear Abena,

We have received your request to delete your ShopGhana account and personal information.

In accordance with the Ghana Data Protection Act, 2012 (Act 843), we will delete all personal data that is no longer necessary for legal or regulatory purposes.

Please note that certain transaction records must be retained for tax and audit compliance as required by Ghanaian law. These records will be securely stored and not used for marketing or other commercial purposes.

Your account and marketing profile will be permanently deleted within 30 days.

Kind regards,  
ShopGhana Data Protection Team

## CUSTOMER B – Lukas (Berlin, Germany)

**Applicable Law:** General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

### A. Does Lukas Have a Right to Erasure?

Yes. Under **Article 17 GDPR** ("Right to be Forgotten"), he has a strong legal right to erasure where:
- Data is no longer necessary
- Consent is withdrawn
- Processing is unlawful

Since his purchase is complete and no disputes exist, the right applies.

### B. Exemptions?

**Article 17(3)** exemptions allow retention for:
- Legal obligation (tax/VAT laws)
- Establishment or defense of legal claims
- Compliance with accounting requirements

So transactional records cannot be erased immediately.

### C. Required Steps

1. Verify identity
2. Assess lawful basis for each data category
3. Delete:
   - Account profile
   - Marketing data
   - Tracking data
4. Restrict retained records to legal necessity only
5. Notify third-party processors
6. Confirm erasure in writing

### D. Response Deadline

Under **Article 12 GDPR:**
- 1 month (30 days)
- May extend 2 additional months if complex (must notify)

### E. If Deadline Is Missed?

Potential consequences:
- Administrative fines up to €20 million or 4% of global turnover
- Complaint to supervisory authorities (e.g., Berlin DPA)
- Compensation claims

### F. Draft Response to Lukas

**Subject:** Confirmation of Erasure Request under GDPR

Dear Lukas,

We confirm receipt of your request for erasure under Article 17 of the General Data Protection Regulation.

Your account profile, marketing information, and associated tracking data will be permanently deleted within one month.

Please note that certain transactional records must be retained to comply with EU tax and accounting laws. These records will be securely restricted and not used for any commercial purposes.

If you have further concerns, you may contact your local supervisory authority.

Best regards,  
ShopGhana Data Protection Officer

## CUSTOMER C – Maria (Los Angeles, California)

**Applicable Law:** California Consumer Privacy Act / California Privacy Rights Act

### A. Maria's Rights

Under CCPA/CPRA she has:
1. Right to deletion
2. Right to opt-out of sale or sharing
3. Right to know what data is collected
4. Right to non-discrimination

### B. Can ShopGhana Delete Immediately?

No because:
- There is an active return dispute (20 days old)
- CCPA allows retention where necessary to:

So, deletion must wait until dispute resolution.

### C. "Stop Selling My Data" Request

If ShopGhana sells or shares personal data:
- Must provide a "Do Not Sell or Share My Personal Information" mechanism
- Must process opt-out within 15 business days
- Cannot require account deletion for opt-out

If no sale occurs → must disclose that fact.

### D. Response Deadline

- 45 days to respond
- One 45-day extension allowed

### E. Required Disclosure

ShopGhana must disclose:
- Categories of personal data collected
- Categories sold/shared
- Business purpose
- Third parties involved
- Retention periods

### F. Draft Response to Maria

**Subject:** Response to Your Privacy Request

Dear Maria,

We have received your request to delete your account and opt out of the sale of your personal information under the California Consumer Privacy Act (as amended by the CPRA).

Your opt-out request has been processed and will take effect within 15 business days. We will no longer sell or share your personal information.

Regarding your deletion request, we are currently required to retain certain information while your active return dispute remains open. Once the dispute is resolved, we will delete eligible personal information in accordance with California law.

A summary of the categories of data we collect, disclose, and retain is attached below.

Sincerely,  
ShopGhana Privacy Team
